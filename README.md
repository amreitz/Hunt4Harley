# Hunt for Harley
An exploratory Javascript 2D game.

See a live preview on github pages: https://amreitz.github.io/Hunt4Harley/

This is a 2D top-down (or perhaps isometric - haven't decided yet) Javascript game I want to develop that follows the adventures of a cat
as they search for the lost friend, Harley. Primarily an RPG, it features some puzzle and interactive elements that require the player interact
with the world in a more sophisticated manner.
